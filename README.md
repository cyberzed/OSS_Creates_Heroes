OSS creates heroes...you can be next!!!                      
==================

What drives the heroes of open source projects...is it fame, is it a road to an MVP or something like it, what is the actual drive behind all this hard labor?

In this session we will dig down and have a look at what drives magnificent people in the industry. It's not always for the carrot in front and it sure ain't due to the threat of being beaten with a stick. It might not be for the awesome reference on the CV, but when we have passed through all the obvious reasons standing
out we look at the deeper meanings behind our sleepless hours.

We all have a great piece of motivation in our mind...we just need to find it.
