###What are the primary fields of intrinsic motivation

* SDT (insert STD joke)

####Autonomy

* What - Task
	* Atlassian
		* 20 % time
		* FedEx / ShipIt
	* 3M
		* 15 % time
		* Bootlegging policy
* When - Time
	* Required hours in the office is just annoying to everyone
		* We can reroute communication in a snap
	* Focus on billable hours creates focus on hours not solving problems
	* Solving problems lead to less time spent or better quality
* How - Technique
	* Constraints leads to increased risk in solving tasks
	* Don't be afraid of new things
* Who - Team
	* Let people get in on the team composition
	* Let the individual curiosity live

####Competence - Mastery

* Autotelic experience
	* Internally drive
	* Trance, not being able to describe the feeling on what was going on
	* Flow
* Goldilocks
	* Not too easy
	* Not too hard
	* Just perfect
* Laws
	* Mindset - infinite improvable
	* Pain - Effort, deliberate practice
	* Asymptote - You will never get to perfection
* General Anxiety Disorder
	* Symptoms
		* Restlessness
		* Easily fatigued
		* Mind blank
		* Irritable
		* Muscle tension
		* Sleep disturbance
	* 50 % of symptoms = diagnose
	* Can be a symptom of lacking flow
	* Denying what we like can give that result within 48 hours if put to the test
* Work can be better than leisure
* Dan North - DevDay - Jackstones: the journey to Mastery

####Relatedness - Purpose

* Activation energy for the living
* Goals in a new perspective
	* Not only for profit
	* CSR is not the same...it's more like CPR...it doesn't bring you back to the living
* We, not I or they
* Ethical correctness
* Painters
	* Intrinsically motivated painters end up producing better results, and have and easier time through draughts
* Science shows performance is better when driven by purpose over first and second drive.

###Where do you find your lost marbles?

*  Never stop playing
*  Finding your third drive
	*  Flow test
		*  5-8 times a day for a week
			*  Feeling

		*  Mark Seemann - Zone out, check in, move on
	*  What will your sentence be?
		*  Created C++
		*  Had three kids
		*  Went to the moon
	*  Reflect
		*  Mastery doesn't happen overnight
		*  Did you do more
		*  Did you do better
	*  Sagmeister
	*  Performance review yourself
		*  Big and small goals
		*  Understand your journey
		*  Be honest to yourself
	*  Seek mastery
		*  You do not progress by doing the same over and over again
	*  Autonomy audit
*  If you are denied SDT you might need fresh air
*  Be aware of both sides of the Tom Sawyer effect
	*  Play can turn into work if we are obliged to do it
	*  Work can turn into play if we aren't obliged to do it

###Bringing it home

	* Clear goals
	* Feedback
	* Goldilocks
* Be aware of how you reward
* Be sure that you pay enough but don't overpay
* Create a leaning environment
* Remember that programming is creating business value...which hardly happens with algorithmic work
* Be aware of the different types of people
